# Analysis of the Situation

* Social media, while omnipresent in our daily lives, is a sub-optimal medium to share events, given that digital content creation is becoming the central activity of said platforms. Other mediums include newsletters and posters, but if I want to find events related to my interests, I have to follow the right social media accounts beforehand, or I need to be subscribed to the right newsletters. Even then, I could be missing out on events that are well-suited to my personality and interests, but are simply not promoted by said mediums.

* Furthermore, when people move to a new place, take on a new hobby, or start a new stage of their life, they often need to build up their social circle from scratch, which can be a long and time-consuming process. Students are particularly familiar with this pain point, particularly foreign students, exchange students, or students who change majors or repeat a year.

* There is an events section in the pocketCampus app which is more focused on academic events rather than social ones, which is not what a student may look for at the end of their day when they are tired and need a break from their busy study schedules.

* Whilst there may be numerous information channels which may communicate their event information to students on campus through various means, there is nothing as to which may give users personalized event discovery experience, which is what a lot of students may be looking out for. 

* Thus, even though the information channels exist about the campus activities, the fact that they often need to be searched for and that the information is not easily accessible to the users shows us why our application is vital for a healthy social life developpement on campus.
