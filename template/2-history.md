* The proof-of-concept (POC) has only the basic functionalities of the app implemented, which focuses on events and associations on campus. This also includes authentication through Supabase (open source as opposed to google firebase), which unlocks a set of features on the app such as creating events, following one’s favorite associations or activities, as well as setting up one’s profile as one may wish. 

* In the current version, we are lacking features which would enable users to communicate amongst themselves regarding their interests. In the POC, we are also lacking the algorithm where one user is able to view the profile of another one in order to see whether they share similar interests or not.

* The design of the application is still very hardcoded and doesn't extend features like screen rotation in the application, which would be very useful for users, hence the developpers may want to implement that for the MVP.
